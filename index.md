### Code Examples

Here's a simple neural network implementation using Python:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Create a simple neural network
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

print("Model created successfully!")
```
